\section{EarthRenew}

- pretty heavy position here, about 10\% of portfolio.

\subsection{April 2022}

\textbf{Bullish Case}

ERTH.CN

Aiming for a 10 bagger
\begin{itemize}
    \item ESG, fertilizer shortage
    \item company executing well
    \item expanding to new facilities
    \item expecting revenue of 24 million where market cap is around 24 million when purchased
    \item regenerative fertilizer with premium for organic, competitive, meets a lot of what the government of Canada wants to invest in, likely to get government subsidies
    \item high insider ownership
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bearish Case}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fertilizer prices go down as high prices result in low prices eventually
    \item Russia war ends within the war (doubt sanctions will go down right away)
    \item Failed to be profitable in Q4, need to raise more capital (unlikely, but possible)
    \item fail to uplist to senior exchanges and raise capital needed for expansion
    \item 
\end{itemize}

If they figure out green hydrogen, 100 times gain. Easily, I think its a 100 bagger, but we will have to see.
