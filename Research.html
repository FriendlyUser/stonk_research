<p>
AQN tanked due to higher interest rates (interest rates since september have interest about 50%), so this is likely to continue to lose money, could rebuy at 10&#x00024; or 8&#x00024;, government subsibies are likely to grow as climate change becomes a bigger issue.
</p>

<p>
Governments have not been taking climate change seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
NEO also tanked a lot, will have to investigate, 5&#x00024; for neo sohuld be solid.

<p>
A lot of losses, some of which are just paper handed stuff.
</p>

<p>
Holding existing positions add to enb.to (convert to usd later) and maybe start an intel position later after q3 dividend from zim.
</p>

<p>
Week of october 15 2022.
</p>

<p>
Wait until friday after snap earnings before buying anything.

<p>
Rhine drying up should be a major supply chain disruption along with the other main europe river.
</p>

<p>
Seems like the cost of food will surge with the addition of wildfires and floods, the group effect will be devasting. Cattle prices are surging as well.
</p>

<p>
Think climate change tech will go up a lot, but its hard to say.
</p>

<p>
Hold bloom until earnings and see how it performs.
</p>

<p>
Seems like sbsw sale was prudent given revised guidance expect it to lose money next quarter.
</p>

<p>
4 to 5 shiploads to get to the end, crazy stuff [<a href="Bibliography.html#LWR-ht-cite.0@youtube_2022">1</a>].
</p>

<p>
With the announcement by the government of canada and germany to produce green hydrogen, I think the technology is provided by watr.v, if this is true, then watr.v is an easy 10 to 20 bagger, but I think within a few years it will be a 50 bagger at these current levels.

<p>
Zim mostly charters ships, with the charter rates up, zim is likely to make less money, 12.81 seems reasonable, but with existing charter rates locked in for a year, I doubt that it will have a major impact, sblk was %17 percent up, zim has managed to outperform before.
%26 percent, for marserk, aiming for %20 especially considering how zim has grew earnings before. So between &#x00024; 14 and &#x00024; 17, think earnings will be % 16.
</p>

<p>
So many problems with fish and heat waves, this is awful.

<h6 id="autosec-18">ZIM Q2 earnings afterthoughts</h6>
<a id="lwarp_template-autopage-18"></a>


<p>
Revenue was about the same, but because they are exposed to spot rates, seems like the price went down, didnt expect earnings to pop like this, with a change in policy to %30 in dividends, seems like a cash cow generator, with the unpriced supply chain disruptions due
to the rhine river issues and other waterways being low for shipping, expect a solid future quarter.
</p>

<p>
Costs went up due to fuel costs, which have dropped again, if revenue remains about the same, expect beat. Other costs up as well.
</p>

<p>
price target &#x00024;60.
</p>

<p>
Failed to understand factors that impact the stonk.
</p>

<p>
Climate change should still be a factor and allow zim to continue to earn record amounts of money.
</p>

<p>
With the rise of ships from 137 to 149 vessels, think zim should meet guidance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bull Case till 2024</b>
</p>

<p>
* New regulations for lng * appreciation to prices
</p>

<p>
* script to perform modelling, maybe in juypter book, doing here makes no sense.

<p>
Before fed meeting, I think I can day trade oil stocks depending on the circumstances, since the economy is strong, I assume powell will go with 0.75%, since this is similar to canada there is no meeting in august, might be a similar policy to canada where they jack up
interest rates to 1.00% or 1.25%.
</p>

<p>
Given how oil and shipping indicies have gone down, we are in technical recession, they will ignore all that to hit inflation. With a policy rate of 0.75% or higher I should not buy oil stocks until the day of the meeting.
</p>

<p>
Tilray seems decent, but want a price or 2 or 3 dollars rather than the current price, with all the competitors going bust, it could do well. If they do the expected, or 0.75% to 1.00%, buy kei and stocks should go up the next day, if lower than expected definitely buy stocks
as they wont raise again for 2 months, think we will have a short relief rally. Considering food bank usage is same as mid pandemic, I think we are easily in recession.
</p>

<a id="lwarp_template-autopage-20"></a>


<p>
They made a lot less money due to investments crashing, very considering, will they even pay a dividend now, questionable purchase now, at September 29 they will pay out 49.5 cents per share, reasonable to acquire this stock at 15 dollars.
</p>

<p>
That should be reasonable, their assets should hold up think a reasonable drop would lead to &#x00024; 20 dollars, could start a small position, they seem like they will keep their dividend but any further deterioration likely means dividend in jeopardy.
</p>
<!--
...... subsubsection Teck ......
-->
<h6 id="autosec-21">Teck</h6>
<a id="lwarp_template-autopage-21"></a>


<p>
Teck I think it will do okay, coal about up 10% for the quarter, zinc about 20% down for the quarter, oil likely 10% to 20% up overall. Teck 5 year average, 50% coal, 25% copper, 23% zinc, 4% energy (maybe 8 percent energy). Plus or minus 5% off estimated earnings,
probably going to miss slightly.
</p>

<p>
If drops to 25% I will buy teck, think thats a decent price.
</p>
<!--
...... subsection June 2022 ......

<h5 id="autosec-22"><span class="sectionnumber">2.1.6&#x2003;</span>June 2022</h5>
<a id="lwarp_template-autopage-22"></a>


<p>
I suspect that powell will keep raising rates, I think that they will level off at 5%. With the new increase of food production and if gas stays around &#x00024;100, its still pretty bad for inflation costs. As inflation continues to rise, the prices will eventually go up, less
chickens and agriculture products (bad harvest this year).
</p>

<p>
So I think inflation will hover around 9% year over year and rates the benchmark rate will hit around 4%, buy bonds at this point.
</p>

<p>
Can buy some for rrsp at 6% or 7% yield.
